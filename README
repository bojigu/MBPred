MBPred - a tool for predicting interacting residues of alpha-helix transmembrane proteins.

Version 1.0 (2th Mar 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MBPred is a Perl pipeline to predict the interface residues of alpha-helix transmembrane
proteins  according to their distinctive evolutionary, co-evolutionary, relative 
position, physical property features, using machine learning methods. It can classify 
interact and non-interact reisidues not only in transmembrane region, but also for residues in cytoplasmic
and extracellular regions. 
The MBPred current version 1.0 used only the integrated classifier. For the future updated version, three single
classifiers specially for three segment residues prediction will be developed. 


System Requirements:
Linux, UNIX, Cluser(to run programs such as Hhblits and freecontact requires a lot of memory, it is recommended to
run these jobs on a cluster rather than on local station, especially if you have a bunch of proteins need to be 
run simultaneously).

Software and Database Prerequests:
1 Perl

2 R
The following R packages need to be isntalled for Random Forest classifier:
library(pROC)
library(randomForest)
library(ROCR)
library(verification)

3 Hhblits -- The HH-suite is an open-source software package for sensitive protein 
sequence searching based on the pairwise alignment of hidden Markov models (HMMs).
you can download and install through the following link:
https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite

4 Hhblits database -- where Hhblits will search and get homology for query sequce
you can download the uniprot nonredundant database through:
http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/%7Ecompbiol/data/hhsuite/databases/hhsuite_dbs/uniprot20_2015_06.tgz

5 phobius -- prediction of transmembrane topology and signal peptides from the
amino acid sequence of a protein.
Here you can get polyphobius:
http://phobius.sbc.su.se/data.html
already in TMBPred1.0/Scripts/phobius.pl

6 freecontact -- a protein residue contact predictor optimized for speed.
Instructions on how to download and install Freecontact through:
https://rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/FreeContact

7 LIPS -- a convenient method for prediction of helix-lipid interfaces of TM helices from sequence information alone.
you can download the LIPS.pl file through here:
http://gila.bioe.uic.edu/lab/lips/
already in TMBPred1.0/Scripts/lips.pl

After the above software were downloaded and installed correcly, then you have to compile the software paths through 
Configuration.pm, please do as the following steps:
1. Uncompress TMBpred1.0.tar.gz in your preferred destination directory
2. Change directory to TMBpred1.0/
3. Change Configuration.pm manually for the path of software and datasets  
4. Do the prediction by simply run "perl TMBPredTest.pl -i inputfile.fasta -c classifer.rf -o PredictOutput.txt" on the command line


Example(in the TMBPred1.0 directory): 
perl TMBPredTest.pl -i /home/students/zeng/TMBPred1.0/TestData/inputfile.fasta -c /home/students/zeng/TMBPred1.0/RandomForest/AllFit.rf -o /home/students/zeng/TMBPred1.0/OutPut/PredictOutput.txt

Compulsory flags:
   -i '/some/file' : use a user specified fast file path as the query transmembrane
                     protein sequence.
Optional flags:
  -c '/some/classifier file' : uses a user specified path to the classifier.
                               without the flag the default is the TMBPred1.0/RandomForest/AllFit.rf.
  -o '/some/file' : writes the output to a user provided output file.
                    Without the flag the output will be given to TMBPred1.0/OutPut/PredictOutput.txt \n"            
  -h : this help;
 
The output prediction file contains three columns : the residue names, the residue number in the 
sequence, and the prediction score, the higher the score is, the more reliable the residue is an 
interact residue.
